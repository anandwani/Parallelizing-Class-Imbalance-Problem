# VectorDistance_GPU
Optimize VectorDistance with GPU

1) To run the code, use 'python VectorDistance_GPU.py'
2) To see the difference in time between CPU and GPU, observe the TimeGraph.png
3) To see the GPU utilization, observe the Profile_VD.png
4) Included the output.txt as well, which includes the traces of output for VectorDistance_GPU.py.

Please note, these experiments were performed on Google Cloud Platform, using a machine with the following configuration:

➢ Machine type: n1-standard-4 (4 vCPUs, 15 GB memory)

➢ CPU platform: Intel Haswell

➢ GPUs: 1 x NVIDIA Tesla T4

➢ OS: ubuntu-1804-bionic-v20210825
