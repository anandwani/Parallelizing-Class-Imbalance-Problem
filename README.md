# VectorDistance_GPU
Optimize VectorDistance with GPU

1) To run the code, use 'python VectorDistance_GPU.py'
2) To see the difference in time between CPU and GPU, observe the TimeGraph.png
3) To see the GPU utilization, observe the Profile_VD.png
4) Included the output.txt as well, which includes the traces of output for VectorDistance_GPU.py.
